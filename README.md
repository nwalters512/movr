Hall passes for a digital era.

In my school district, administration has been aggressively deploying new technology to our students. Within a few years, every student in the district will have an iPad. Everything from grades and lesson plans to quizzes and worksheets are being distributed and accessed electronically.

All except one thing: hall passes.

At my school in particular, passes are increasingly a hassle. If students want to see a teacher during a special block called Seminar, they have to get advanced approval from the teacher they wish to visit. However, it can be difficult to find teachers to get a pass, and if you have to see multiple teachers, getting a pass from all of them during passing period can be a challenge.
